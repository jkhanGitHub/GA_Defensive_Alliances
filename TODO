difference function in Genome class not working properly
exponential rankselection proabably works but needs wayyyyyy too much time
think about solutions to change size in networks it kinda stagnates around Genome_Length * ProabilityOfExistance

add methods for manipulation of found defensiveAlliances
implement how defensiveAlliances should be handled

Forkjoins dont work on macAir only PC atleast for me

TODO
Think about how to handle duplicates in the best way
