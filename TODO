difference function in Genome class not working properly
exponential rankselection proabably works but needs wayyyyyy too much time

add methods for manipulation of found defensiveAlliances
implement how defensiveAlliances should be handled

Forkjoins dont work on macAir only PC atleast for me
Mutation methods 2 and 3 are really slow and take   wayy too many ressources
